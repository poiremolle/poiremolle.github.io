**My name is MÃ©lissa and i am currently based in Copenhagen, Denmark** (no, not the Netherlands, Denmark is not part of the Netherlands)

This is a space exploring the intersection between tech and art. It's also a space for thinking about belonging, race, sexuality and human connection.

I am using Jekyll, a static site generator hosted on GitHub to make this blog/portfolio available to the world wide web.
