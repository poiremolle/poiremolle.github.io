You can always get the time and date here (provided you computer has the right time and date.......) This program is what I based my video submission on for the exhibition 24,50 SEKUNDER, a collaboration project by [ST:ART](https://www.sydhavnteater.dk/start/) and [Udstillingsstedet](https://sydhavnstation.info).  You can see my video along with 14 other fantastic works both in Copenhagen and online. 

See it at [Sydhavn Station](https://sydhavnstation.info/2450-sekunder/) until March 17.

See it online on [Sydhavn Teater's website](https://www.sydhavnteater.dk/24-50/) until April 8.
