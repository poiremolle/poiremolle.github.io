Here is a simple living room.  The indoor lighting changes according to the clock on your computer.

Initially I wanted to make a garden that grew outside, from which you could harvest vegetables and de-weed daily.  Then I decided I wanted to make a living room and have a potted plant growing bigger every year. But I haven't figured out how to make it grow.  Any suggestions welcome :D I also would like to make a plate of snacks that you can grab (for which I'll just make an array from which each item will get removed on mouseclick.)

I just wanted to get this room out there. But I'm looking at Machine Learning and sound visualization at the moment which seems more relevant to what I want to be doing.  I'd love to work with musicians and sound artists and also AI somewhere down the road.
