I’ve been feeling a lot of sadness lately, the kind that bubbles up out of nowhere and spills out in the form of tears.  White people's reactions/non-reactions in the face of the undeniable existance of racism has deeply affected me. It's showed me how much work I need to do to heal past experiences.

I spent my childhood surrounded by white people and despite my best efforts to simoultaneously [emmulate whiteness and perpetuate the model minority myth](https://www.mic.com/p/no-more-model-minorities-its-time-for-asian-americans-to-confront-anti-blackness-22974833) (get good grades, don't bring "smelly" food to school, stay in the shade, shut your mouth when someone is being racist, don't retaliate), my being "part of the gang" felt conditional. Whiteness being standard, the condition was being that I was being white enough to be understood by them.  

When I started meeting people who were bicultural like me, people who spent all or most of their lives in Québec, but also had cultural roots elsewhere, i felt seen.  That was until I moved to Denmark and suddenly the loneliness set in all over again.  I realize that I haven't worked on healing the hurt from the feeling of being Other, of not belonging, of people not automatically understanding my experience.  Man, the tiredness of having to explain your experience and tailor it in a way that makes the very real experience sound believeable to white people... it's a heavy weight to carry. 

### What now though?

I want to tell more stories, find ways to use tech in order to make an impact with stories.  People who benefit from white supremacy will always have a tendency to want to look away because it's easier that way.  It sucks to look at a problem that you are intimately a part of but that also feels unsurmountable at the same time. I get that. But white people are not powerless.  Just speaking up in your community is really powerful in itself.  Maybe you won't change everybody, but you might inspire someone who will then go on and make their own difference. 

That way, you can also save Black and Indigenous people and other people of colour [doing the exhausting work of talking to white people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race) who "didn't realize that racism still affected us so much" or that have the starting point that racism isn't really a thing anymore or that our experiences are exagerated. Read books, read articles, listen to podcasts and talks by BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) and reference them when you talk to other white people.  That way you make it clear to other white people that you are not just another liberal whitey talking out of their ass, but more importantly you also elevate the voices of black and indigenous people and other people of colour. 

Anways, I totally went on a tangent. 

### How can I create tech tools that facilitate activism and the conveying of important messages? 

That's what I'm wondering now... the future getting increasingly shaped by various technologies and I want Black voices, First Nations, Inuit, Métis voices, POC voices, trans voices, cis women's voices, LGBTQIA2S+ voices, the voices of people from diverse classes, body types and abilities to be part of history this time around.  We cannot, for all of our sakes, let the story of how technology took over the world be written solely by cis white people, especially white cis (person whose sense of personal identity and gender corresponds with their birth sex) men.    

### How can we facilitate the learning of coding and programming for aforementionned people and secure jobs within the tech industry?
