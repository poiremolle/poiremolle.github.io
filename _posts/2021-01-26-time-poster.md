First post of 2021 ! I'm interested as always into art not made by people who call themselves artists, the so-called "non-art". Sometimes it takes the form of used up Pictionary drawing pads, or a phrase left on a whiteboard from a previous class. Sometimes the "non-artist" is a computer, simply executing a code. This is what this is. The shapes are placed on the screen according to the time found on your computer.
